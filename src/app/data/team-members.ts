      about: `
          Hardeep Anand is recognized as a transformational executive and thought leader in integrated water resources management. Over a career spanning more than 20 years, he has consistently delivered top-notch performance and groundbreaking improvements for public and private organizations in South Florida. Mr. Anand has served as a torchbearer for operationalizing water resilience in Miami-Dade County through his active engagement with the 100 Resilient Cities and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as with various local, national and international organizations.
          <br/><br/>
          Mr. Anand currently leads an $11.4 billion water infrastructure program in Miami-Dade County, which includes the implementation of State-mandated Ocean Outfall Legislation aimed at reducing nutrient loadings to water bodies, minimizing the use of ocean outfalls by 95 percent, and achieving 60 percent water reuse by the year 2025. Additionally, Mr. Anand oversees the planning, design and construction of a portfolio of more than 250 systemwide infrastructure development projects. He leads this charge with a vision of shifting from a transactional approach to water infrastructure planning, to one which will transform the water system in the region.
          <br/><br/>
          As a champion of the “One Water” concept, Mr. Anand advocates for water governance across watersheds and a collaborative regulatory framework to prioritize water-related investments within the region. He spearheaded the development of the City Water Resilience Framework, which resulted in the selection of the Greater Miami and the Beaches region as one of only five areas from around the world to participate in creating a global blueprint for resilient urban water systems.
          <br/><br/>
          Understanding the inherent need for collaboration with various stakeholders in the region, Mr. Anand founded the Resilient Utility Coalition (RUC) to advance water infrastructure resilience efforts. Through RUC, partners from public utilities, private industry and academia are working together to operationalize policies and practice while making systems more resilient to hurricanes, infrastructure failure, increased precipitation, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. Mr. Anand’s success with RUC has led to interdisciplinary and integrated planning that is improving water quality, public health and the efficient use of resources.
          <br/><br/>
          Keenly aware that industry must remain conversant with ever-shifting climate change issues, Mr. Anand is leading the development of a “OneWater Academy” knowledge sharing platform. He sees the mission of OneWater Academy as ensuring a sustainable and proficient workforce within the water sector by serving as a global clearinghouse for water-related information.
          <br/><br/>
          Mr. Anand currently serves as policy director of the Resilient Utility Coalition, as a board member of the Water Research Foundation, as a commissioner on the U.S. Water Alliance National Blue Ribbon Commission for Onsite Non-potable Water Systems, and as a member of the University of Miami Construction Management Advisory Board.
          <br/><br/>
          Originally from Tanzania, Mr. Anand is a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida and holds a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, a Master of Science in Civil Engineering, and a Master of Science in Management of Information Systems
